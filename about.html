        Stellar Horizon Tours was founded with a singular vision: to democratize space exploration. We believe that the "Overview Effect"—the cognitive shift reported by astronauts when viewing Earth from space—is an experience that can unite humanity. When you look back at our planet from the darkness of space, you don't see borders, wars, or politics. You see a fragile, glowing blue marble that connects us all. Our goal is to share this perspective with as many people as possible, inspiring a new generation of environmental stewards and global citizens.

    <aside>Did you know? Because there is no gravity compressing your spine, you can grow up to 5 centimeters taller while in space! Don't worry, you return to your normal height once you are back on Earth.</aside>

        Question: Is there an age limit?
        We have successfully flown passengers ranging from 18 to 82 years old. As long as you pass the basic medical screening, space is open to you.
