# Project
Theme:
The project theme is "Stellar Horizon Tours," a fictional commercial space tourism agency.

This theme was selected because it provides a dynamic and comprehensive framework that naturally aligns with all the required pages and 
HTML elements of the assignment. The concept allows for clear segregation of content, such as detailed travel packages for the services 
page table, and a structured application process for the contact form.



File Organization:
Root Directory: Contains all four required HTML files:

index.html (Home Page)

about.html (About Page)

services.html (Services/Projects Page)

contact.html (Contact Page)

assets Folder: This folder contains all necessary images and media files. All image links use relative paths, 
such as src="assets/image-name.jpg".


Challenges:
One of the main challenges I faced was distinguishing between similar semantic HTML tags. Specifically, deciding when to use 
article versus section required some research to ensure I was following best practices. Additionally, implementing tags like 
details for the first time was a new experience, but I learned how they contribute to a better user experience.
